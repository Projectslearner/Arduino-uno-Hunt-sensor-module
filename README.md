### Line Detection Sensor Monitoring

#### Project Overview

This project uses a line detection sensor to detect the presence of a line on a surface. When the sensor detects a line, it sends a signal indicating detection. This information is then sent to the Serial Monitor for monitoring.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Board**
2. **Line Detection Sensor Module**
3. **Breadboard**
4. **Jumper Wires**

### Block diagram



#### Circuit Wiring

1. **Line Detection Sensor:**
   - Connect the output pin of the line detection sensor module to digital pin 8 on the Arduino.

#### Instructions

1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
   - Connect the components according to the circuit wiring instructions.
   - Ensure all connections are secure.

2. **Monitor Line Detection:**
   - The Arduino continuously reads the signal from the line detection sensor.

3. **Display Results:**
   - When the sensor detects a line, the message "Line detected" is printed to the Serial Monitor.
   - When no line is detected, the message "Line NOT detected" is printed.

#### Applications

- **Line Following Robots:** Utilize the sensor to guide robots along lines in navigation tasks.
- **Automated Systems:** Implement in automated systems for line detection in manufacturing or assembly lines.
- **Position Sensing:** Use the sensor for precise positioning in various applications.

# Arduino-uno-Hunt-sensor-module
I'm not familiar with a specific "Hunt sensor module" commonly associated with Arduino Uno. It's possible that it's a specialized sensor with a different name or a less commonly used component. If you have more details or specifications about the sensor, I can provide a description based on that information.
